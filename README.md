# README.md

In this project, we are webscraping a real estate portal that unifies different real estate projects in Colombia.

We are going to extract and generate a database of these projects.

Afterwards, we are going to create a web scrapper for fincaraiz.com in order to analyze the current state of the market, especially, the average squared meter in particular locations.

The idea is to identify which real esta project has a competetive advantage compared to the current offers in the market. Gradually, we are going to integrate more real estate portals similar to finca raiz, which will act as market data providers (metro cuadrado, mercado libre, ciencuadras)

This repository will have all the webscraping bots.
